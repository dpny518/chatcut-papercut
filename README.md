This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Project Summary: We've created a Next.js application called "ChatCut PaperCut," which is an editor application with a three-panel layout. The application consists of:

A left sidebar with a collapsible file structure
A center panel with a toolbar and text editor
A right panel with a tab system for additional content or tools
The application uses the App Router structure of Next.js and incorporates components from shadcn/ui, particularly for the sidebar. We're using TypeScript for type safety and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Key Components:

AppSidebar: Implements the file structure in the left sidebar.
CenterPanel: Contains the main editor area with a toolbar.
RightPanel: Implements a tab system for additional functionality.
Current State:

We have a basic layout set up with the three panels.
The sidebar has a collapsible file structure.
The center panel has a placeholder for a text editor and toolbar.
The right panel has a basic tab system in place.
Next Steps:

Implement actual text editing functionality in the center panel.
Add more interactive elements to the toolbar.
Develop the content for the right panel tabs.
Implement state management if needed (e.g., for managing open files, editor content).
Add any necessary API integrations or services.
This structure provides a solid foundation for building out the rest of the application's functionality. The modular component structure allows for easy expansion and maintenance as the project grows.
