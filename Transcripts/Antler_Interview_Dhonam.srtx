1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,040
Kaiwen
 This music is fine, right?

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:07,759
Dhonam
 Yeah, I think it's okay.(...) We should probably change
 the scenery for every... Yeah, yeah. That way it's different.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,279
Kaiwen
 You mean when it cuts?

4
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,880
Dhonam
 Yeah, we can try to capture anything too. Yeah, yeah.

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:15,960
Kaiwen
 Okay.

6
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,920
Kaiwen
 Let's begin.(...) What's your
 background? Where do you come from?

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:31,879
Dhonam
 Okay, so, yeah, I'm American, but the nationality is
 Tibetan and Bhutan. And I was born in India and lived in England

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,560
Dhonam
 and then went to America for most
 of my life. And I went to college at Johns

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,479
Dhonam
 Hopkins. I did biomedical engineering there
 because when I was young I didn't really know...

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,600
Dhonam
 I was good at everything, but I didn't know which
 subjects to do. And also my granddad was a doctor, my dad is a

11
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:51,679
Dhonam
 doctor. So I was interested in health, so I
 went to Hopkins. And then when I was there, BME.

12
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:58,159
Dhonam
 And then that's when I started like entrepreneurship.
 And also I felt biomedical engineering was not enough. It was too

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,799
Dhonam
 diverse. I felt like I didn't know enough.
(...) So then I did my PhD and so I went to UC Irvine.

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:11,239
Dhonam
 I wanted to do MEMS. So as a professor, he invented
 something called "Come Drive" which is like every airbag

15
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:18,400
Dhonam
 accelerator. So I went to study under him.(...) And then
 the work was MEMS. I thought it would be revolutionary. It is

16
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,200
Dhonam
 revolutionary. But the work
 itself wasn't that much fun. I was

17
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,959
Dhonam
 in clean room all the time.
 We were building chips and things.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,079
Dhonam
 So that project kind of got shifted to later on. It was
 like a neuro-implational brain. So I did some work with that

19
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,159
Dhonam
 for NASA for something else, for the micro propulsion
 system. But at the same time, I always wanted to be entrepreneur.

20
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:42,239
Dhonam
(...) So my other PhD classmate,
 he was doing the eye stuff. Something

21
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:48,239
Dhonam
 with lasers in the eye. But we both
 found a niche in the children game thing.

22
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,840
Dhonam
 Basically exposing children to multiple languages to
 help them grow. And it got pretty popular with investors. So we

23
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:02,159
Dhonam
 started a company on that. So that was my first
 company. Pivoted many times. And then we got acquired. But I wouldn't

24
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:08,240
Dhonam
 say successful acquisition. Just like share transfer.
(...) And then I did another company in China. They went pretty

25
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:14,879
Dhonam
 well. And then it wasn't really a startup. It was a
 startup. But what happened was there was a robotics company and it

26
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,039
Dhonam
 invested. And I kind of got the employees. And it was a
 little different type of startup. Because it was startup but we

27
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,840
Dhonam
 were running like a big company. And then with the COVID
 and other situation that kind of got shut down. So after that

28
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:33,560
Dhonam
 I kind of took a break. And then didn't know what to do.
 I was in Southeast Asia. I liked Asia. And then I went USA for

29
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:39,800
Dhonam
 a little bit.(...) And then I realized I wanted to
 build a company again. So I came to... I chose Vietnam. I'd never

30
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:45,919
Dhonam
 been here. But I liked Southeast Asia. And Vietnam's
 population was growing. And I knew it was a place that has an

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,280
Dhonam
 economy that's growing. So I came here to try to build
 a new company. My plan was to just soak up and meet people and

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,879
Dhonam
 build a company. I was lucky to see Adler because it
 was exactly what I needed. I wanted to actually find co-founders

33
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,360
Dhonam
 and try to build my next thing.
 And that's how I ended up here at Adler.

34
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:09,639
Kaiwen
 What made you consider
 joining Adler?(...) What was it about the

35
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,000
Kaiwen
 program that you heard about or
 someone you knew that attracted you?

36
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,400
Dhonam
 So yeah. So the main thing was it was
 before I did. And before... Yeah, very early. I

37
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,080
Dhonam
 didn't really have an idea what I wanted
 to do. And I really wanted to find co-founders.

38
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:29,120
Dhonam
 So previously my co-founders were my friends. And I
 think it's not a good idea because...(...) I mean, it could be a

39
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:35,800
Dhonam
 good idea. But you don't have skills that complement
 each other. And both of you are learning. And it's more like, hey,

40
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:41,719
Dhonam
 you be business, you be tech. You're just dividing it
 based on feeling no one's actually a specialist, you know, at the

41
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,520
Dhonam
 business side. And we were
 always doing our product development.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,120
Dhonam
 You know, based on our gut and based on our feelings.
 You kind of see it now. I'm doing the film editing with experts

43
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:57,759
Dhonam
 in this field. And I see other startup companies doing
 the film products. And there's stuff like I would have designed

44
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,560
Dhonam
 with my co-founder before. Like as a tech person. And
 it's not actually what the industry needs. So I think it helped

45
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:08,479
Dhonam
 being an Adler a lot.(...) Yeah, finding
 co-founders, finding people with domain experience. Okay.

46
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,759
Kaiwen
 And from all their master classes that you took and the

47
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,000
Kaiwen
 coaching centers, what's the
 biggest thing you learned at Adler?

48
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,040
Dhonam
 I think the, well, I think it's the co-founder and the
 boot camps. It wasn't really the master class, but it was just

49
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,839
Dhonam
 the boot camps were very good to, you got to test out
 your personal, you know, see if you guys conflict, if you match.

50
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:38,639
Dhonam
(...) I think with like Cowan, who I'm partnering with,
 we had a boot camp and he had his own idea. But we were able to

51
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,319
Dhonam
 do a different idea for the boot camp and he was fine
 with switching and he was supportive. So I think it kind of shows

52
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:48,920
Dhonam
 that you can work together and your mind is open to
 other things. So I think that's very good how they do the lunch

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,879
Dhonam
 roulette, boot camps and that people
 actually interact in real world situations.

54
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:53,720
Kaiwen
 Yeah.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,800
Kaiwen
 There is a lot of kids out
 there who have ideas or who don't

56
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,720
Kaiwen
 have ideas, but they want to
 do something, start a new business.

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,920
Kaiwen
 Would you, if, would you
 encourage them to do so? And if you do say

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,160
Kaiwen
 something encouraging or give
 them a warning if you don't encourage it.

59
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,680
Dhonam
 Yeah, I think startups are a long journey.

60
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:22,879
Dhonam
 So once you become a startup, so there's a traditional
 trajectory when you work, you become specialized in your job,

61
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:28,839
Dhonam
 you can always work in those jobs. I think once you
 become a startup, you kind of become a generalist and it could be a

62
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,439
Dhonam
 bad thing if you had no career before, no training. So
 if you're a young kid and you become a startup, you might be

63
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:40,600
Dhonam
 good at everything and you never developed. So I do
 recommend younger people to actually work a little bit, get some

64
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:47,000
Dhonam
 experience and at least domain experience. And so that
 way they kind of know the field and also if the startup doesn't

65
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:54,360
Dhonam
 work, they can get a job,(...) not just be a startup guy
 and have those skills in that sense. Just knowing a little bit

66
00:05:54,439 --> 00:06:01,759
Dhonam
 of everything might not be good. So I do recommend, I
 mean, if you're young and you do it, you fail fast for early and

67
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,519
Dhonam
 then get a job or if it doesn't
 fail, then you're successful, right? But yeah.

68
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,000
Kaiwen
 Okay, great.
