1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Alima
 What's your background? Where do you come from?

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,799
Kaiwen
 I'm from China. I'm a filmmaker. That is my background.

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:18,359
Kaiwen
 And I lived in Shanghai for eight years now.(...) And
 there I made commercials and documentaries. And I made a short

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:25,920
Kaiwen
 film that's in a lot of festivals.
(...) And I grew up in the northeastern part of

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,359
Kaiwen
 China and went to the U.S. for
 university and high school and got my education there.

6
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,520
Kaiwen
 So all of that is a big part of my identity.

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,479
Kaiwen
 Right now I'm in Vietnam trying to
 expand that identity into the tech space.

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,799
Alima
 Do I keep rolling?

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,799
Kaiwen
 Yes, yes.

10
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,960
Alima
 What made you consider Antler?

11
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:03,520
Kaiwen
 My co-founder had the idea of starting a company,
 period. And then suggested that we go to an accelerator

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,799
Kaiwen
 because we are idiots. We
 don't know anything about business.

13
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:19,560
Kaiwen
 And in the beginning I was like,(...) "Why don't we...
 we could potentially do it ourselves and try it out?" But having

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,519
Kaiwen
 been here I would say that we
 would have been fools if we tried it the

15
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,280
Kaiwen
 hard way without having any
 support from people who have done it before.

16
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,159
Alima
 What's the biggest thing you learned so far?

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,120
Kaiwen
 The biggest thing I learned
 is that(...) you should find the

18
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,719
Kaiwen
 people who are born to do that
 thing that you're trying to have done

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,480
Kaiwen
 instead of trying to pick up
 every skill along the way and then waste

20
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:00,760
Kaiwen
 a lot of time and realize that
 "Oh, you're not made to do that thing."

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,840
Kaiwen
 It's kind of like when you
 graduate in college you feel like you can do

22
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,479
Kaiwen
 anything in the world and then there is
 a common place for doing everything you can.

23
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,719
Kaiwen
 But there is a common place to know your limits.

24
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:25,120
Kaiwen
 And when you look at the people here with
 their different talents for tech, for marketing, for...

25
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:35,319
Kaiwen
 It's like if someone makes a marketing material here,
 wants to make marketing materials here and then wants to beat me

26
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,960
Kaiwen
 at filmmaking, that would be
 foolish. You should ask me.(...) So by the same

27
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:47,960
Kaiwen
 token,(...) if I want to see a technology
 implemented in a way that I will actually use,

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,159
Kaiwen
 we should ask the people who are born to do that thing
 because I could learn and I thought about it. Go on udemy.com

29
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:04,159
Kaiwen
 and learn JavaScript and blah blah blah. And I would
 have only wasted 10 more years of my life and got nowhere.

30
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,000
Alima
 Say something encouraging to
 the future generation of founders.

31
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,199
Kaiwen
 The world is not a very
 encouraging place for new ideas because you are

32
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,080
Kaiwen
 surrounded by people who are
 close to you in a good way and a bad way.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,800
Kaiwen
 The people who know you are the
 people who know your limits the best.

34
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,879
Kaiwen
 And that can be discouraging.

35
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:41,800
Kaiwen
 But when you go into a new environment, when nobody
 knows you or what you cannot do, all of a sudden you will find that

36
00:03:41,879 --> 00:04:00,960
Kaiwen
 a lot of your potentials come out. So if you
 are interested in an idea that you think is real,

37
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,919
Kaiwen
 regardless of whether you have
 business experience, you could consider an

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,040
Kaiwen
 accelerator like this if only because
 it's three months of your life with no downside.

39
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,279
Kaiwen
 And the upside is you find that you love it
 and then you found the people to build your idea with.

40
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,000
Kaiwen
 So I would say it's a lopsided bet
 that you have nothing to lose against. Okay.
